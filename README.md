## Job Search Web App Installation and Setup Guide

### Prerequisites:
Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that you have installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Root Folder**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the root folder of the project.

    ```bash
    cd <root-folder>
    ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**: Install the required backend dependencies by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Node Server**: Start the Node.js server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

5. **Navigate to Frontend Folder**: Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the frontend folder named `job-search-front-end`.

    ```bash
    cd job-search-front-end
    ```

6. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Install the required frontend dependencies by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

7. **Start the Frontend Server**: Start the frontend server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

8. **Accessing the Web App**: The web app should now be accessible on your localhost. If prompted to start the server at a different port because the backend is running at port 3000, type 'y' to confirm.
